# Install Laravel on Your Local Machine

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- PHP (Recommended version: 7.3+)
- Composer
- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- MySQL or other database (optional, for database-driven applications)

## Step 1: Install Composer
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP that Laravel relies on.

1. Download and install Composer by following the instructions on the official website: [Composer Download](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

2. Verify that Composer is installed by running `composer --version` in your terminal.

## Step 2: Install Laravel
Laravel offers a convenient installer to create new Laravel projects.

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to install the Laravel installer globally:

   ```bash
   composer global require laravel/installer
